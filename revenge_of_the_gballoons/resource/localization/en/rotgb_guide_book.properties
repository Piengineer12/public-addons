rotgb.guide.page.core_concepts=Core Concepts
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.1.header=RotgB Game SWEP
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.1.description.1=The RotgB Game SWEP is found under the spawn menu > Weapons > RotgB.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.1.description.2= The RotgB Game SWEP can be used to place down towers and remotely trigger activated abilities. Money transfer is also possible via the SWEP.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.2.header=Towers
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.2.description.1=Towers placed by the RotgB Game SWEP are used to pop gBalloons.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.2.description.2= Interacting with them will open a menu where you can upgrade the tower, set the tower's targeting or sell the tower.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.3.header=Infinity Fusion
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.3.description.1=Certain final tower upgrades require Infinity Fusion. For these upgrades to be purchasable, towers of the same type that are fully upgraded on all other paths must be present in the map.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.3.description.2= When such an upgrade is purchased, the tower will absorb all other towers of the same type, converting them into Infinity Power and raising the tower's sell cost.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.3.description.3= The effects of Infinity Power depend on the tower. In general, Infinity Power will raise two of the tower's stats by 1%% per point.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.3.description.4= The amount of Infinity Power gained is based on the formula (S/M)^0.5Ã—200-199, where M is the minimum amount of cash required for Infinity Fusion and S is the amount of cash spent on all towers of the same type.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.4.header=Navigation Mesh
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.4.description.1=If a Navigation Mesh is present in a map, the gBalloons will use that to create paths for reaching their targets.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.4.description.2= Otherwise, the gBalloons will move in straight lines. Previous versions of RotgB required the usage of a NavMesh, but this is no longer the case.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.5.header=gBalloon Spawner
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.5.description.1=This entity can be found under the spawn menu > Entities > RotgB: Miscellaneous. When used, it will spawn increasingly powerful gBalloons in waves.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.5.description.2=%nIn Sandbox, you can edit this entity's properties. Right-click on this entity in the context menu, then click on "Edit Properties..." to access the menu.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.6.header=Wave Presets
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.6.description.1=Custom wave presets can be made in the Wave Editor. It is found under the top-right of the spawn menu > RotgB > Server > gBalloon Spawners + Targets > Wave Editor.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.6.description.2=%nWhen playing in multiplayer, you need to synchronize your wave file with the server for it to work. You can only do that if you are an administrator.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.7.header=gBalloon Target
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.7.description.1=This entity can be found under the spawn menu > Entities > RotgB: Miscellaneous. gBalloons will always prioritize gBalloon Targets over any other entities.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.7.description.2=%nIn Sandbox, you can edit this entity's properties. Right-click on this entity in the context menu, then click on "Edit Properties..." to access the menu.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.8.header=Waypoints
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.8.description.1=You can set down Waypoint gBalloon Targets with the gBalloon Target Waypoint Editor, under the top-right of the spawn menu > RotgB > Tools > gBalloon Target Waypoint Editor.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.8.description.2= gBalloons that reach a Waypoint gBalloon Target will immediately navigate to the next connected gBalloon Target without inflicting damage.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.8.description.3= Connections between gBalloon Targets can be set up by the gBalloon Target Waypoint Editor. Waypoint gBalloon Targets can have multiple incoming and outgoing connections.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.9.header=gBalloon Target Weight
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.9.description.1=When gBalloons need to select between multiple gBalloon Targets, they will always prioritize the gBalloon Target with the highest weight.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.9.description.2= The exception is for Waypoint gBalloon Targets with multiple outgoing connections,
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.9.description.3= where the gBalloon Target weight for each outgoing connection is instead interpreted as the ratio of gBalloons that get sent to each connected gBalloon Target.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.9.description.4= For example, if a Waypoint gBalloon Target's outgoing connections are linked to two other gBalloon Targets with weights 2 and 1, every third gBalloon will navigate to the latter.
rotgb.guide.core_concepts.extra=For information on the Hammer World Editor KeyValues, Inputs and Outputs for each entity, please visit this discussion: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1616333917/1742231705671196872/
