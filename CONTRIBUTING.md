# Want to contribute? Read this first!
I welcome all types of contributions, no matter how small. It does not necessarily have to be a donation. There are three main ways to contribute:

## 1. Making Suggestions / Bug Reports
If you have an idea that you want to share or bug that you want to mention, you can simply post a comment on the relevant Steam Workshop page of the addon.
If your suggestion / report is not related to any addons in particular (such as an issue about my GitHub repository), you can make a comment on my Steam profile page.
I usually see all of your comments within 24 hours.

Unfortunately, I have to juggle a lot of things, mostly related to life, so it is possible that I might eventually forget about your comment after reading it.
In case I do forget, you can feel free to follow up your comment one week after posting it.

You can also post an issue on GitHub about it, but please note that I less actively check GitHub issues.

## 2. Making Pull Requests
If you are a GLua-savvy person, you can fork this repository and edit my addons to implement a feature yourself. You can do this under the MIT license.

If you want to make your edits part of my addon, you can make a pull request.
However, I will take a lot of time to examine whether your code is efficient, robust and clear enough, as well as checking for any kinds of backdoors, adverts and the like,
so please be patient as it may take up to one month for me to respond to your pull request.

**Important: Some addons are written in MoonScript (.moon files) rather than Lua directly. If .moon and .lua files appear side-by-side, you must add your changes to the .moon file and not the .lua file.**

## 3. Donating and Spreading the Word
You can donate to me via [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/piengineer12). Please note that for now there are no exclusive rewards for donating.
(If you have a suggestion for a reward, feel free to comment!)

You can also just tell other players about my addons that you like.
The more people use my addons, the more motivation I have in keeping them maintained or updated with new features.
